# Templates Not Working :

The template demo provided in [changelog 19.1.3](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/BC5079/vue-components-the-new-structure-for-the-slot-scope-in-component-templates)
or the demo in [grid-example](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-vue/blob/master/example/components/grid-example.vue) of devextreme vue are behaving oddly in case of rendering templates.

## Benefits of solution :
1. forces user to declare templates as function in javascript.
2. helps us have seperation of concerns at html and results in easily maintainable js files.
